"""TRY THIS: LIST SLICES AND INDEXES Using what you know about the len()
function and list slices, how would you combine the two to get the second half
of a list when you donâ€™t know what size it is? Experiment in the Python shell
to confirm that your solution works."""

x =[1,2,4,5,6,7,8]
print(x[len(x)//2:])
#output: [5, 6, 7, 8]
#slice indices must be integers
